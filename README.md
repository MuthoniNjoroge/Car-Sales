## Introduction 
I came across the dataset online in Kaggle and I have been trying to practice my skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization and thought this would be a good opportunity to put my skills to work
## Problem Statement

    - YTD Total sales.
    - MTD Total sales. 
    - YOY Growth in Total Sales.
    - Difference between YTD sales and PYTD sales.

2.  Average Price Analysis

3. Cars Sold Metrics 
    - YTD cars sold
    - MTD cars sold 
    - YOY Growth in Cars sold

## Data Modeling 
Since it was a time-based analysis the first step was to create a calendar table to better establish a relationship with the other table.
Then I went ahead to connect the original table and the calendar table with the common column being the date and formed a one-to-many relationship.
